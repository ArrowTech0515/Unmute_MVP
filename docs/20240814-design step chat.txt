okay, thank

until id 200 it's the same widgets?

no

it is not updating 
as i already said several times

yes i understand, i just think maybe it's loading a different user, 

invoke the addmyip
the ap and t

that was the issue, the tester loaded different users, 


you should use the add my ip with app=app name (also for next apps) 

okay, wait a moment , i will try to test and let's see together once

okay, maybe tomorrow you can test all, yes i will ask someone from my team too, try to finish because i want to start next app soon and we need also apply design
